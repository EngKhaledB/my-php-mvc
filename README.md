#WorkFlow

This is a complete MVC architectured and built by me!

1- Router find the route

2- Route converted into class & method

3- Class autoloaded PSR-0

4- Check if the class type is Controller or RestController

4.1- If the class type is Controller then check if the method exists => call it else show message

4.2- If the class type is RestController => then the RestController constructor will check the Method and call the child class methods based on it
